Project1
1.	Write a code that return digit number. .
2.	We have only !, &&, || and <. Write >, >=, <=, == and != comparisons.
3.	User writes day, hour, min and sec. Prepare it for order.
4.	Use a function that controls if the number is even.
5.	Find the sum of digits of a number given by user.
6.	Write a code that converts number to its invers. Ex: 1234 to 4321
7.	Write a code that takes input numbers from user until user says no. After, code writes total number, min, max, mean.
8.	Write a code that flushs standard input buffer until takes new line.
9.	Write a code that shows Collatz. If the number is even, num/2. If the number is odd, 3num +1.
10.	Write a code that calculates factorial of a number.
11.	Write a code that calculates user defined terms converge to in 1 -1/3 +1/5 -1/7... series.
12.	Write a code that prints starts to standard input as number entered by user.
13.	Write a code that prints the prime factors of a number.
14.	Write a code that calculates given year is leap.
15.	Write a code that to find the day of the year on the given date.
16.	Write a code that generates random passwords with 6 - 10 characters. 

Project2
1.	Write a code that creates random arrays and prints them.
2.	Write a code that gives the sum of random array.
3.	Write a code that calculates standard deviation of an array.
4.	Write a code that finds the maximum number of an array.
5.	Write a code that finds runner-up of an array. (Second maximum)
6.	Write a code that reverses the array.
7.	Write a linear search algorithm that takes key from the user.
8.	Write a Bubble sort algorithm.
9.	Write a swap function for the array. (pointer)
10.	Write a Merge array algorithm.
11.	Wrtie a code with Bubble sort which shows odd numbers first then evens.

Project3
1.	Write a code that takes all the input lines till the new line comes.
2.	Write a code that calculates the length of input string.
3.	Write a code that add exclamation at the end of the string and writes it to standard input.
4.	Write a code that counts the specific character.
5.	Write a code that compares two given strings like strcmp.
6.	Write a code that takes string from user and deletes specified character from that string.
7.	Write a code that reverses the taken string.
8.	Write a code that gives the number of words given.
